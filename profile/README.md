# LISA Analysis Center

## About

The LISA Analysis Center on GitHub is a collaborative space dedicated to developing prototype data analysis pipelines for the LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) project. This organization hosts several repositories under development to address research and development priorities for end to end LISA data processing, including noise reduction, gravitational wave signal extraction, and catalog production.

These repositories provide tools and resources for researchers and developers to contribute to the LISA project's data analysis efforts. The collaboration space is designed to facilitate the development, testing, and sharing of code and data related to gravitational wave detection and analysis.

Feel free to explore these repositories to learn more about their capabilities and potentially make contributions.
